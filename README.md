# OAuth2.Unity.Example



OAuth2 authentication example to any Unity project against any app.


This certain case allows you to use two different user accounts, which are connected under the same server. Each way to login (user accounts) will make reference to a different app. 


This Authentication system uses the OAuth2 protocol, which is a token based authentication system.

The main script is Authentication.cs , where you will find all the important logic, including some file serialization logic to store the tokens in a secure way.


I will update this soon with some explanation regarding HOW-TO use it.


Feel free to use it :)
